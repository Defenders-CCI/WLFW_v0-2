### This data offers some measures of outputs, not outcomes

While there is a lot to learn about the Working Lands for Wildlife (WLFW) program
using this app, remember that this data cannot tell us whether the conservation
status of covered species is improving. The laws that enable WLFW prohibit the
Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) from disclosing the actual location 
of properties receiving funds through WLFW; and the biological outcomes of work 
performed under WLFW are not required to be measured. We assume that more acres 
treated, and more dollars spent doing so, are improving some aspect of the 
conservation status of covered species. But we do not have the data to test that
assumption.
